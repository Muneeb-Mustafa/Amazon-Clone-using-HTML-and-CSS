Conclusion
This Amazon Clone project demonstrates my ability to build a responsive and visually appealing website using only HTML and CSS. It was a valuable learning experience in replicating the structure and design of a well-known e-commerce platform, focusing on layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid. While it doesn't include functionality like user accounts or payments, it's a solid foundation for understanding the basics of web design. I look forward to adding more features in the future as I expand my skills with JavaScript and backend development.
